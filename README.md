## Overview
The goal of this challenge was to build a web application that displays the current weather for a selected city. I chose to use a city search function instead of a fixed list, allowing the user to discorver the current weather for any given city in the world. 

## Features
This web application has many features which are summarized below.
- Current temperature (displayed in celsius)
- Description of current weather and icon
- What it currently feels like (displayed in celsius)
- Maximum and minimum temperatures for the day (displayed in celsius)
- The time at which the sun rises and the sun sets (displayed in local time)

## Process 
When I went to tackle the challenge I set a goal, for this weather app. Although this challenge was a technical challenge I wanted to build something with a bit more purpose and value. Which led me to create the minimalist weather app that I have always wanted. That is the reason that the time of the sunrise and sunset is being displayed as watching the sunrise is one of my favourite things to do. 

### Design Mocks
I created some design mocks to plan out what I was building and the best way to do so. I started by creating a low fidelity wireframes and then medium fidelity mocks as seen below. They are quite simple as the weather app I was building was going to be minimalistic but definetly helped in the planning.

### Tools
When trying to select different tools behind this challenge, by nature I stopped to take a moment to compare and contrast each tool to better make a decision. I chose to use the OpenWeatherMap as it provided the data I wanted unlike some of the other APIs. On top of that I decided to use straight vanilla JS instead of using a framework simply due the simplicity of the challenge. With very few components using react did not seem worth it and it gave me the chance to show of my skils in vanilla JS :D. 

### Testing
Throughout the entire time building this web app, I was constantly sure to break up and test different areas of my code. This helped ensure the quality of the web. For example if the city you type does not exist a message will appear to try typing in a valid city - ensuring to the user that the app is not broken. Though I would have like to write unit tests to more methodically test my web app, but due to interviews, tests and assignments there was not enough time.  

## Learnings
From making this web app, it allowed me to go back to the basics of JS without any frameworks and I don't regret as it was quite simple. Often you need to take a step back and figure out what makes sense. 

## Improvements
More often than not you are forced to prioritize features, there simply isn't enough time to build every single feature you would like to see. Below are a summary of features had I been able to spend some more time on this challenge, I would have liked to implement. 
- Be able to display both celsius and fahrenheit
- Future forecast
- Show multiple cities
- Keeping the selected city for the next session
This is simply just to name a few, there are so many things that could be added but it's all about prioritization and understanding the user!
